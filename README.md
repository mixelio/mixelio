--------------
Front-End developer - TypeScript/React
--------------------------------------

In a world of endless possibilities, I choose simplicity.

I write code that doesn’t distract — it serves. Clear, lightweight, intentional.

React, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind, Vite — my tools for building interfaces

where every component has purpose, and every style knows its place.

Coding is my flow state — where time dissolves and meaningful things emerge.

Always learning, always moving — the path of growth never ends. 🚀
